    // QUESTION:

    //Gary is an avid hiker.He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography.
    //During his last hike he took exactly n steps.For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step.
    //Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:


    //A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
    //A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

    //Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.


    //For example, if Gary's path is s=[DDUUUUDD] he first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain 2 units high. 
    //Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.


    //Function Description


    //Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.It must return an integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary traversed.


    //countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

    //n: the number of steps Gary takes
    //s: a string describing his path

    //Input Format:

    //The first line contains an integer, the number of steps in Gary's hike. 
    //The second line contains a single string , of characters that describe his path.

    //Constraints:

    // 1. 2<=n<=10^6
    // 2. s[i] € {UD}


    //Output Format:


    //Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.

    // Sample Input:
    // 8
    // UDDDUDUU

    // Sample Output:
    // 1

    // Explanation:
    // If we represent _ as sea level, a step up as /, and a step down as \, Gary's hike can be drawn as:

    //_/\      _
    //   \    /
    //    \/\/

    // He enters and leaves one valley.
}
